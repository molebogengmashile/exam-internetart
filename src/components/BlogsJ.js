       <h2>Essay: Miao Ying's Blind Spot </h2>
           <p>
           For my internet artwork, I was interested in how the internet becomes a reflection of real life. Our internet interactions become 
           similar to our physical social interactions. One artwork, which I think best represents a reflection of how we interact with society
            both in real life and digitally is Miao Ying's Blind Spot (2007). Blind Spot is an 1869-page Mandarin dictionary that Miao Ying manually
             annotated to show the 2000 search terms that were censored in China at the time. This essay will analyze the relationship of between the
              internet and real life as well as explain the extent in which Miao Ying's Blind Spot demonstrates how our spaces are not our own. I will 
              also be explaining how this particular piece acts as an inspiration for my own artwork. 
          <br></br>
          <br></br>

          Censorship in China is a highly controversial topic that has received significant attention from the international community. The Chinese government
           has implemented strict censorship laws and regulations to control the flow of information within the country. This has resulted in a heavily monitored media 
           
           landscape, where access to certain websites and social media platforms is restricted or blocked entirely (Albert and Xu, 2017). The censorship laws also extend to print media,
            with books, newspapers and magazines subject to pre-publication review by government officials. While the Chinese government claims that these measures are necessary for maintaining social stability and protecting national security, critics argue that they infringe upon free speech rights and limit access to information for citizens. Understanding the complexities of
           censorship in China is crucial for us as it is a clear example of how what is allowed in real life is also allowed online. 

           <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Through this thought-provoking creation, Ying challenges our perception of the internet as an unrestricted space. She deftly draws 
          attention to the barriers and blind spots that govern our online interactions, mirroring the constraints and regulations we encounter in
           our physical lives. It is a witty commentary on the intertwined nature of the real and digital worlds, urging us to question the extent of
            our freedom and autonomy in both spheres. Although this art work is in book form, it would not have been possible to create it without the
             internet. The internet gives access to a wide variety of information in very little time. Dictionaries, which take a lot more time to navigate
              through, are also harder to get access to. To have internet censorship be more important than physical media, show how much of a threat it is to large 
              corporations. This artwork inspires me to want to reflect my own digital
           life in the real world. I want to show it's not just the websites we visit and shape our world view, but also those who own them.

           <br></br>
          <br></br>

          In a world where the internet has become an integral part of our lives, Miao Ying's masterpiece holds a mirror up to society, reflecting the 
          intricate connection between our physical and digital interactions. Through her thought-provoking artwork, 
          she challenges us to question the boundaries and limitations imposed upon us online, just as they exist in our day-to-day lives.

       <h2>Blog 1: Internet Art</h2>
           <p>
           This is a critical analysis of Olia Lialina's internet artwork Online newspapers. The artwork consists of five newspapers
            from different parts of the world. The newspapers all have animated gifs spread-out throughout the pages. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung
             paper has animated roses, the Daily Jang paper has colorful balls, the USA TODAY paper has American flags, the Wall Street Journal Europe 
             paper has different wild animals and lastly the Dajiyuan has street fighter characters on it.
            Right below the papers are links to the real online versions of these papers that exist today. 
          <br></br>
          <br></br>

          The artwork utilizes real physical objects to make art that is only accessible online. Olia has taken one form of art and new art in another 
          medium. Are the newspapers art? No, however, they have become a recorded part of history that has been transformed into art, internet art.
           In the article, The work of art in the age of the internet (2020), Carrier claims that an artwork that has been duplicated loses its aura 
           and thus does not have the same value as the original. The original newspapers might not even exist anymore, but they have been immortalized in Olia's work. 
           They have a historical significance to internet art. Their physical essence did not have any meaning, besides being sheets of paper with news printed all over them, until
            they were transformed to images and then to internet art. These papers have lost their initial aura as newspapers of a
           certain time period; however, they have gained a new one through what they have become and what they symbolize today.

           <br></br>
          <br></br>
          The internet has the ability to act as an archive to historical digital artifacts, however, these old creations need to be modified to
           suit the current software, (O'Toole, 2019).  The links to the current online newspapers show the difference between the Online newspapers 
           artwork and the actual online newspapers. The actual online newspapers try to imitate physical newspapers with the way they are written and
            how the audience must read them. Olia's newspapers look identical to the physical ones with the animated gifs and digital medium being the
             only difference.The newspapers were all published in August 2004, from the 2nd to the 9th. According to onthisday.com, the only major events 
             to occur during that time were the deaths of American funk musician Rick James (6th of August), American composer David Raksin (9th of August),
              French politician and president of the European Court of Justice Robert Lecourt (9th of August), American jazz guitarist Tony Mottola (9th of August),
               American musician Don Tosti (2nd of August) and Belgian comic artist François Craenhals (2nd of August). The significance of the dates and to the artwork 
               is unknown and so are the countries in which the newspapers are from. "The web has an immense influence on our daily lives and the social relationships we construct,
           making undeniable the importance of internet culture and its associated internet creations." (Danae, 2019).  

           <br></br>
          <br></br>

          The animated gifs on each paper could be trying to undermine the newspapers or just be a mockery of the serious tone they have.
           They could also just reflect the artist's interests at the time. Maybe they represent the pop culture of the different countries during 
           that period. The reasons to why the artists made this artwork are unknown,
           this artwork is important because it reflects on a part of internet culture in history.

       <h2>Blog 2: Aesthetics in Web design </h2>
           <p>
           Usually, when people visit a website, they are looking for something. They have a reason for spending their time on the page. 
           The job of the web page is to help them find what they are looking for as quickly and efficiently as possible.  Whether it be the latest
            celeb goss, which coffee machine gets you the best coffee ever, or how to remove a suspicious red stain on a carpet, people will always turn
             to the internet for information, and they will probably find a website that can help.
            Whether or not they find what they are looking for can be greatly influenced by the aesthetics of the page. 
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          According to dictionary.com, an aesthetic refers to a philosophical theory or set of principles governing the idea of beauty at a given time
           and place.  Websites often rely on visuals to communicate to users. These visuals then create the aesthetic of the site. It is impossible for
            a website to not have an aesthetic as every website is trying to communicate information to the users. Visual communication happens in every text, picture, 
            video, color, or any other form of expression one can see on a screen (Thorlacius, 2007). The most important thing about these visuals is that they help the user find what
             they are there for. The site needs to communicate quickly and efficiently and therefore requires a balance between functionality and aesthetics to do so in the best way possible (Thorlacius, 2007).
              The functionality refers to how the
           user can move through the site and the aesthetics should allow the user to do so without confusion. 
           <br></br>
          <br></br>
          What is more important, functionality or aesthetics? Can one exist without the other on a webpage? Since aesthetics are automatically created
           whether a web developer has taken them into consideration or not, functionality does not exist without aesthetics. Even if a website's sole 
           purpose is to be pretty, it still requires functionality to some extent. It often seems as though the visuals on a page only exist to support
            the functionality. This is true to some extent, however, it really depends on what type of site it is and what information it is presenting
             (Thorlacius, 2007). For example,
           search sites such as google.com focus more on functionality to not distract the user from what they are looking for. 
           <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Many sites follow conventions or trends with how they present their aesthetics. There are rules that designers follow that have become 
          standard on most sites as well. These rules can often determine whether a site is good or bad. The rules focus on the effectiveness of 
          the navigation, the use of color, and the overall layout of the page (Liu, 2018). Aesthetics can influence how we interact with a product. 
          Most people determine the value of something based on how it looks and how it is presented. They would rather have a more attractive product
           overall. This can be applied to websites as well (Nikolov, 2017).  
         A more attractive and effectively communicated site will often be chosen over others even when they sell the same product. It is the 
         overall user's experience on the site that designers must focus on in order to keep them coming back.  The sense of sight plays a major
          role in how people make decisions, and it would be in everyone's best interest if aesthetics on websites were taken a lot more seriously.

       <h2>Blog 3: The Internet, Society and Design Justice. </h2>
       <p>
       Since the dawn of time, humanity has thrived due to our ability to solve problems. From the wheel to electricity to the internet,
        we have come up with solutions to provide a better quality of life for ourselves. These solutions underwent a thorough design process
         to provide us with the best possible product,
        however, with every new solution, comes a new problem to solve. 
        <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Each technological advancement people have made has left a community (often a minority) excluded, this can be seen in the rise of the 
          internet and how it has created the digital divide. The digital divide is the gap of communication created between parts of the world 
          does use the internet as part of their daily lives, and the parts that don't, (Daniolou, 2020). These parts of the world are often places
           that have lower levels of education,
           lower incomes, and poor healthcare systems, (Daniolou, 2020). 
           <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Often, designers aim to solve problems that affect themselves. Although it may not be possible to accommodate everyone with our current
           technology, it doesn't mean that those who have been excluded should stay silent.
